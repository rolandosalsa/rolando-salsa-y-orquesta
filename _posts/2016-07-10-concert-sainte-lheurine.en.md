On Saturday the 2nd of July, Rolando Salsa & Orquesta was invited by
the 
[All Dances](http://www.alldances.fr/) Association of Sainte-Lheurine
to animate their mega *Fiesta Latina*.
We were happy to accompany dancers of the Zumba Party (on the right)
with a selection of lively musics such as
[Un poquito más](/un_poquito_mas.html),
[Mi cuerpo me pide salsa](/un_poquito_mas.html),
[Salta Salta](/un_poquito_mas.html)
or the famous
[dueña del Swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWlcpsp4XCU).
We also played a Latino concert with various songs from salsa, cumbia
or bachata for the greatest pleasure of lovers of latin music.

A big thank to the [teachers](http://www.zumbaalldances.com/zumba.php?p=professeurs) Aloïs, Jennifer, Zakary, Stéphanie and all the volunteers
for the wonderful organization. We also thank all the participants for the
awesome ambiance !
