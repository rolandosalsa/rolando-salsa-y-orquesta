[Some extracts](/un_poquito_mas.html) from our first album are now available on
our web site.
  "Un poquito más"
  aims at impregnating a new style, fruit of a human meeting between
  artists belonging to various musical universes. It is influenced by the
  greatest names of porto-american salsa such as the Fania All-Stars,
  Héctor Lavoe or El Gran Combo de Puerto-Rico.
  One can also recognize some inpirations from miscellaneous horizons,
  going from classic music to the most festive songs of la Réunion.
  These compositions subtly mix the languages of Cervantés and Molière
  by means of a wide range of latino rhythms such as Salsa, Cumbia or
  Bachata.
