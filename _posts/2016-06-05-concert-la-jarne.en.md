On Wednesday, the 1st of June, Rolando Salsa & Orquesta was pleased to
perform on stage for the 7th edition of the festival of the "Mercredis
éclectiques" of la Jarne.
We wish to thank the numerous people who came to dance and sing
together the classics of portorican Salsa, peruvian cumbia,
bachata... as well as some of the new songs from our
[next album](/un_poquito_mas.html) !
A big thank to the Comité Des Fêtes, the volunteers and the
president Mr. Vincent Coppolani for the wonderful organization.

You can find more information, photos and videos of the event
